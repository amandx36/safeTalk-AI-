##  ðŸ”¹  How They Work Together

    The user types a message.

    The message first goes to the Distress Detection model.

        If the score is above the threshold (for example, 0.7), the system Marks according to the text user provide and also give the score form 0-1 

        If the score is below the threshold, the system says: "Normal."

    Then a decision is made:

        If risk is detected, the bot sends a supportive message, helpline information, and flags for escalation.

        If normal, the bot forwards the user input to the chat model, which generates a reply.

    The final output is shown to the user.
